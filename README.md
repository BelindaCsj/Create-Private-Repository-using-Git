# Create-Private-Repository-using-Git
Using git tools to create private repository. Except downloading process, all the other steps do not need internet connection. This offline installation solution is suitable for projects that do not support online service and it's very suitable for teams' cooperation.

A guide document describe the process about how to install the software and how to use git as the repository management tool. Details would be updated when I encounter and solve new problems. Welcome everyone to feedback on the problems encountered. 

Installation packages I have used are also provided.

In my case, the client software is installed on a Windows laptop, and the remote warehouse is on a Linux server.
